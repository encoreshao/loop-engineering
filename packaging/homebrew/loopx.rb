    <<~EOS
      First run: create your config skeleton (existing files are kept):

        mkdir -p ~/.loop-engineering
        for f in projects topics loops ai_cli; do
          [ -f ~/.loop-engineering/$f.json ] || sed "s|{{HOME}}|$HOME|g" #{pkgshare}/config/$f.json.template > ~/.loop-engineering/$f.json
        done

      Then check what is left to set up (AI CLI, GitLab/Slack credentials):

        loopx doctor

      Start the dashboard backend with `brew services start loopx`.
      The scheduler (`loopx scheduler`, every 15 minutes) is a second launchd
      job; render and load it from #{pkgshare}/launchd/loopx/ or use the
      installer: https://github.com/@REPO@/blob/main/docs/RELEASING.md

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/loopx --version")
  end
end
