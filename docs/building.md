# Building and running loopx and LoopX.app

Needs the Rust toolchain (`~/.cargo/bin` on `PATH`) and the Xcode Command Line
Tools. Full Xcode is not required.

## Build the backend

```bash
cargo build --release          # target/release/loopx
```

## Run Web mode

Use a throwaway sandbox so nothing touches the real `~/.loop-engineering`:

```bash
export LOOP_ENGINEERING_HOME=$(mktemp -d)
export HOME=$(mktemp -d)
export LOOP_UPDATE_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
target/release/loopx serve --port 18420
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:18420`. Without the three variables it uses the real
config and the default port 8420 (an install may have picked another port; see
the dashboard LaunchAgent plist).

## Build and run the Mac app

```bash
bin/scripts/build_loopx_app.sh target/release/loopx --arch arm64 --out dist/LoopX.app
open dist/LoopX.app
```

- `--arch universal` needs a universal `loopx` (`lipo -create` the two cargo targets).
- Auto-update is on only when both `SPARKLE_FEED_URL` (https) and
  `SPARKLE_PUBLIC_ED_KEY` (base64 Ed25519 public key) are set at build time;
  setting only one is an error. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
- The app is ad-hoc signed, so the first launch may need right-click > Open.
- The app has no Dock icon or window (`LSUIElement`): look for its icon in the menu bar,
  plus the notch or HUD once the backend is up.
- If launchd refuses to run the ad-hoc signed bundled agent (a crash report with
  `Launch Constraint Violation` in `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`), the app falls back
  to spawning the bundled `loopx serve` itself after a few seconds; that backend stops with
  the app and logs to `outputs/loopx-serve.log`. Developer ID signing removes the need for it.
- On launch the app registers the bundled `loopx` as a login-item agent with
  `SMAppService`, which changes the real machine. Use Web mode for sandboxed
  checks. If a `loopx serve` is already running (`loopx.lock`), the app connects
  to it and offers to replace it when it is older than the bundled one.

## Swift package only

```bash
cd macos/LoopX
swift build && swift test
swift run LoopX      # no bundled backend: start `loopx serve` separately
```

## Verify

```bash
cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check
LOOPX_BIN=target/debug/loopx python3 -m pytest tests/test_cli_contract_*.py tests/test_e2e_loopx_*.py -q
```
