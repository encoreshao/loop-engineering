# Daily GitLab Issue Loop

## Goal

Every weekday, check GitLab issues already assigned to the configured user on the configured GitLab instance, pick up anything new (a fresh issue or a new comment on one already being tracked), and then take exactly one of four actions per issue: implement a fix, verify it, and open a merge request when the ask is clear, scoped, and genuinely needs a code change; answer directly with a GitLab comment when the ask is clear but needs no code at all (a question, a status check, a request for information); post a GitLab comment asking for clarification when the ask is ambiguous; or, when the issue has already been handed off to someone else to review, wait — no GitLab comment at all, just one Slack reminder after a week if nobody has followed up. Failing verification also gets a GitLab comment instead of a guess. Every comment the loop does post is short, goal-based, and structured markdown (a one-line summary, then bold-labelled sections with one fact or question per bullet): it states a decided next action grounded in the issue's full history, or shares a progress update — never one dense, hard-to-parse paragraph. The loop also gets more capable over time: reusable lessons learned per project (fix patterns, gotchas, root-cause categories) are recorded per issue as markdown task-memory files and read back on later runs — see `bin/memory_store.py` (entries recorded before this format existed are still read via `bin/project_memory.py`).

## Setup

New to this loop? Run `bin/scripts/setup.sh` once — it installs the `gitlab-config` skill this loop depends on (from [encore-skills](https://github.com/encoreshao/encore-skills)) and scaffolds `~/.loop-engineering/projects.json` from the template if you don't have one yet. The dashboard's Settings → Skills view (`/settings?view=skills`) shows a live view of what's installed.

## Scope

Which GitLab projects to track, their local checkout paths, target branches, GitLab username, worktree scratch directory, and per-project install/lint/test commands are **not** hardcoded in this repo — they live in `~/.loop-engineering/projects.json`, since every team member running this loop has their own local checkout paths. See `config/projects.json.template` for the exact format, and `bin/loop_config.py` for how the loop reads it.

The loop never self-assigns issues — it only tracks issues already assigned to the configured `assignee_username`, on the projects listed in that config file.

## Expected output

Each run produces or updates:
- `outputs/daily-review.md` (and an archived copy under `outputs/history/`)
- `PROGRESS.md`
- Slack messages via the webhook at `~/.slack/config.json` (per-issue start/finish + one end-of-run digest, sent every run — including mornings with no assigned issues at all)
- Zero or more GitLab comments and zero or more opened merge requests

## Safety boundary (fixed — does not loosen with time or repeated success)

- **Never merge a merge request.** The loop's job ends at "MR opened, verification passing." Merging is always a manual step for the human.
- Every code change happens inside an isolated git worktree, under the configured `worktree_root`, on a branch named `loop/issue-<iid>`, never on the checkout's target branch.
- An MR is only opened if the project's own configured `test_cmd`/`lint_cmd` pass, and the diff only touches files relevant to the issue.
- Only the command allow-list in `LOOPX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` may run — no arbitrary shell, no dependency upgrades, no reading `.env`/credentials/SSH keys.
- Issues are processed one at a time, sequentially — never multiple worktrees/fixes in parallel in the same run.
- In `observe` mode (the default) the same verification failure on the same issue is not retried within a run — it escalates via a GitLab comment instead. In `gate` mode the loop retries at most `stop_conditions.max_iterations` times (see below); it never opens an MR whose tests/lint fail.
- The loop only touches: issues/comments/MRs on the projects listed in `~/.loop-engineering/projects.json`, its own git worktrees (under the configured `worktree_root`), and its own state files (`PROGRESS.md`, `outputs/`).

## Verification gate (observe vs gate)

After the agent's work on an issue, the runner independently re-runs the project's own `test_cmd`/`lint_cmd` (from `projects.json`) inside the worktree the agent used, via `ProjectCommandsVerifier` in `bin/loop_verifiers.py`, inside `LoopRuntime`. No worktree or no configured commands (the agent made no code change) is a vacuous pass, not a failure. `verification.mode` in `loops/gitlab-issue/loop.yaml` selects what the result does:

- **`observe` (default).** The real result is recorded (`observed_passed` in the iteration's evidence and the `verification.external_completed` event) but the iteration always passes, so outcomes are unchanged. The agent still pushes and opens the MR itself.
- **`gate`.** A failing check fails the iteration. `LoopRuntime` retries up to `stop_conditions.max_iterations` (2) with the failing command's output tail as feedback (`format_feedback`, bounded). The agent's allowlist drops `open_merge_request.sh` and `git push` (`_allowed_tools(gate=True)`), a `GATE_OVERRIDE` prompt section tells it to write a handoff JSON to `outputs/handoffs/<run_id>/<alias>-<iid>.json` (also in `$LOOP_HANDOFF_PATH`) instead, and the runner (`finalize_gated_issue`) reads it (`read_handoff`) and runs `open_merge_request.sh` itself only after verification passed.

Gate-mode outcomes: `mr_opened` (an `issue.completed` event with `gated: true`), `answered` / `escalated:agent` (the agent's own handoff action), or `escalated:<reason>` with reason `verification_failed`, `handoff_invalid` (handoff missing or malformed - never an MR), `mr_open_failed`, or `project_config_error`. Every escalation except `project_config_error` posts a GitLab comment and adds the `loop:needs-human` label; the unpushed `loop/issue-<iid>` branch stays in its worktree for a human to inspect, and a Slack notification is sent. `project_config_error` has no project to address, so it only logs, emits the `issue.escalated` event and notifies.

The Harness -> Gates view (`/harness?view=gates`) shows the observe-mode agreement rate (the agent's "fixed" claim vs the external check, per issue, verifier config errors excluded) and what the gate did (blocked, retried then passed, escalated), per project, plus each loop's current mode. CI audits every `loops/*/loop.yaml` with `loop_cli.py audit --min-score` (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

### Rollout checklist

1. Ship with `mode: observe`.
2. After at least 5 weekday runs, open Harness -> Gates. If agreement is 90% or higher and no project shows a systematic false failure (flaky suite, lint baseline - see CLAUDE.md's rubocop notes), set `mode: gate` and raise CI `--min-score` to 80 in the same commit.
3. If a project is systematically red for reasons unrelated to the fix, fix its `test_cmd`/`lint_cmd` in `projects.json` rather than weakening the gate.
4. Gate mode multiplies the per-issue worst case to `max_iterations x (agent + test + lint)`, up to 6x `max_runtime_minutes`. `config/loops.json.template` now sets `gitlab-loop`'s `timeout_seconds` to 43200, but that only applies to new installs/backfill: an existing `~/.loop-engineering/loops.json` keeps its old 21600. The dashboard does not expose this field, so raise it by hand in that file before flipping to gate.

### Limitations

- Gate enforcement on Codex is prompt-only: `codex exec` has no per-command allowlist, so "do not push / do not open the MR" is an instruction, not a harness-enforced denial as it is on Claude.
- A `project_config_error` escalation cannot comment or label (see above).
